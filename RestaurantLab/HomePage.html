                    You've had burgers from the worst, now have from the first!  Willy's Fat Burs is the home of the burger.  Back in 1987 Willy crafted this creation from dust and woodchips.  This was the original burger design and after 30 years in business we know the design was made to last.  Crafted from state of the art German engineering our burgers go down your throat quckier and more efficent than those claiming an earlier burger design.  With our distinct single location in a 4 foot by 90 foot restraunt you know you'll feel at home at Willy's Fat Burs!
